# Assignment 1: Creating and Using Complex Prompt Templates
## Objective: Combine multiple prompt templates to create complex and flexible conversations with an AI model.

Task:

Implement a ChatPromptTemplate for a conversation with an AI travel agent. The conversation should dynamically include the user's travel details, like departure and destination cities.
Extend the template to include system messages that define the AI's role.
Generate a final conversation prompt using the template and provide input values for all dynamic fields.
Requirements:

The template should include both system and human messages, with dynamic parts that can be replaced at runtime.
Ensure that the template handles different scenarios, such as varying city names and additional user questions.
Submission Instructions:

Submit your Python script implementing the complex prompt template.
Include the output showing the final conversation prompt generated by the template.

# Assignment 2: Integrating Message Classes with AI Models
## Objective: Learn to integrate SystemMessage and HumanMessage classes with an AI model for context-aware interactions.

Task:

Create a conversation using SystemMessage and HumanMessage to instruct an AI model on its role and ask it a question.
Pass this conversation to the ChatCohere model using the invoke method.
Print the model's response and analyze how well it understood the instructions.
Requirements:

Ensure that the AI model receives proper context through system messages before responding to human queries.
Experiment with different instructions in SystemMessage to observe changes in the AI's behavior.
Submission Instructions:

Submit your Python script that sets up and invokes the conversation with the AI model.
Include the output showing the AI's response to the provided conversation.
